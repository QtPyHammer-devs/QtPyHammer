## Responsibilities
We want GitHub to accurately show ownership.  
And if we had janitors, they would get credit for 90% of the code.  

So keep your code clean, or:
 1. The linter will be sad
 2. Someone else will read your code
 2. They will clean it
 3. GitHub will mark it as **their** code

> PEP8 is not hard.

Being a contributor is a responsibility.
As such, following the rules will grant you respect.
You are not entitled to this respect, but you will earn it.
