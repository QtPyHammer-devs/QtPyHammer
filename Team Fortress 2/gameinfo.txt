			// system call.)

			// game file indefinitely (after you have left the server).  Servers CAN have
			// custom content that overrides the default game files, it just needs to be
			// packed up in the .bsp file so that it will be mounted as a map search pack.
			// The map search pack is mounted at the top of the search path list,
			// but only while you are connected that server and on that map.
