## Code of Conduct
Please read the full [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)  
We will hold you to it's standards, even if you haven't read it  
The rules apply to the discord too. Read it! (please)  



## Do I Need Experience?
Not at all.  
Casual contributions are what we're all about.  
That's why QtPyHammer is made with Python.  
We're making an editor that puts users first.  

Our aim is to have an editor anyone can use, and code anyone can edit.  
We aim to have anyone that wants a feature added or bug fixed to have the tools to do so.  

There's no pressure to keep contributing either, no contribution is too small.  
If you know what you want to work on, ping a veteran programmer and they'll help you get started  
If you want to contribute, but aren't sure what to do, check out `#feature-requests` for inspiration



## How can I contribute?
### Feature Requests
We keep a [list of requested features](https://github.com/snake-biscuits/QtPyHammer/wiki/Features-requested-by-users), be sure to read it to see if your idea is already on the list!
most of these feature requests were left in the [Discord's](https://discord.gg/sW4Gzke) `#feature-requests` channel.
We take ideas through Discord so everyone can discuss them, not just the programmers!

Just typing: "I wish hammer could do X" is a totally valid way to help direct and shape the project
If your idea is particularly exciting, you may find yourself making...


### Paper Prototypes
When a discussion sparks up, you may find yourself planning features right in the #feature-requests channel!
These discussions really help flesh out ideas.
Plus, they give programmers a clearer understanding of how to *make your dreams come true*  


### Wiki Entries
If you want to help others understand how QtPyHammer works under the hood, consider helping write a wiki entry.
You can work with the programmer that wrote a particular part of code to write up documentation


### Art
We need:  
 * A splash screen  
   ~~Please draw our mascot swimming in code spaghetti with little meatball floaties~~  
 * Icons for buttons

We would like:  
 * GLSL Shaders (programming can be art too!)  
 * UI Mock-ups  

And most importantly:
 * Our [Discord](https://discord.gg/sW4Gzke) needs more emotes!


### Sharing Tips
We want to give users tips on the splash screen.  
Do you know of a hammer feature that's hard to find?  
Tell us all what is and where to find it in: [tip_of_the_day.txt](tip_of_the_day.txt)


### Reporting Bugs
TODO: Bug report issue template


### Other
Can you think of another way to contribute? Add it to this list!  
That's a contribution too!



## Contributing Code
QtPyHammer gets it's name from being written (mostly) in Python.  
If you don't have it installed, get [python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-385/)

### Joining the Crew
Programmers make the code, so they get to decide what they make  
Anyone can become a programmer! But you will have to learn  

We appreciate everyone with knowledge who uses it to help those that wish to learn.  
Experience has value, and we respect our ~~elders~~ veteran programmers.  
If you're starting out and need help learning, get the attention of a programmer.  
And please understand that while we appreciate teachers, it's not compulsory.

If you're not sure who to ask: `@bikkie` on discord, they'll help you get set up  
TODO: have a list of people who are comfortable to help newcomers in Discord


### Setting up a Virtual Environment
We recommend using a python virtual environment.
They make life easier for all programmers working on QtPyHammer by ensuring everyone is working with the same code.
When everyone working on the code is using the same versions of each dependency, tracking down bugs becomes waaay easier than it would be otherwise
Be sure to check the `#announcements` channel in the discord for any changes to `requirements.txt`
If you have changed `requirements.txt`, make sure an announcement gets sent out!

So, setting up that virtual environment:  
First, open a terminal at the top level (usually QtPyHammer-master)  
Then, run this: `$ python -m venv venv`  
(Linux users may need to install python-venv first)

Activate your new virtual environment:  

| Operating System | Command                        |  
|------------------|--------------------------------|  
| Windows          | `$ call venv/scripts/activate` |  
| Mac OS           | `$ source venv/bin/activate`   |  
| Linux            | `$ source venv/bin/activate`   |  

Finally, install all dependencies with pip  
`$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`  

You can now run QtPyHammer from the terminal
`$ python hammer.py`


### Working with GitHub
TODO: GitHub is hard for beginners, @asd can you think of anything I've missed?
 * Check out [Atlassian's Guide](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control)
 * Make sure to pull the latest version before you commit!  
 * Communicate with other [contributors](https://github.com/snake-biscuits/QtPyHammer/graphs/contributors) to avoid code conflicts!  

If you're planning on making big changes:  
 1. Talk to other programmers to see who can help you with your workload  
 2. Make a branch to avoid conflicts with the master branch
 3. Name your branch something short that explains what changes you're making

(Nagging a programmer to write documentation is OK, but only in small doses)



### Coding Prototypes
When adding code for the first time, understanding how the program fits together can be confusing  
That's why we have the `prototypes\` folder!  
It's a space where you can experiment without getting tangled up in the rest of QPH

TODO: @asd, what works for you? please describe your approach / experience here.



## Style Guide
We use [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) around here  
It's not very fun but it keeps the code neat & tidy  
And who doesn't like tidy code? (bikkie, the answer is bikkie)  
Some warnings are OK to leave in when prototyping  
Such as:



### Linter
If you're using an IDE we recommend getting a linter plugin.  
Every time a commit is pushed to `master`, GitHub checks all python scripts meet PEP8 standards.  
Having a linter plugin in your IDE helps you catch warnings before you push.   
You will probably need to install `flake8` to use these plugins.  
Add it to your virtual environment like so:
```
$ call venv/scripts/activate
$ pip install flake8
```
Most of us use these linter plugins

| IDE                 | Plugin                                                  |  
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|  
| Atom                | [linter-flake8](https://atom.io/packages/linter-flake8) |  
| Visual Studio Code  | TODO: find a vscode PEP8 linter                         |  

If you don't use an IDE that's OK.  IDEs have their benefits but some of us prefer notepad.  
Notepad++ if you're fancy.

If you don't / can't get a linter to review your code, you can still use flake8.  
```
$ flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
$ flake8 . --count --exit-zero --max-complexity=10 --max-line-length=127 --statistics
```
GitHub also automatically runs these commands every time we push to GitHub.  
You may have another programmer ping you with a polite request to look at these warnings.  
It's OK to ask someone else to help clean up your formatting, but we prefer you do it yourself.  


### Documentation
Please use comments in your code to help explain how it all works.
Be sure to use docstrings too. Consider writing a wiki page or two
Your future self will thank you, trust me

### Testing
Write tests! Run tests! Found a bug you can't fix? Ask for help!

## Frequently Asked Questions
### What is QtPyHammer?
QtPyHammer is an alternative to Valve's Hammer World Editor,
written from scratch, in Python.  

### Who are the QtPyHammer Team?
The QtPyHammer Team is mostly made up of [TF2Maps](https://tf2maps.net/) members.  
Some of us are programmers, most of us are Hammer users.  
We're here to make a Hammer for the users, a Hammer that anyone can repair when it breaks.  

We decide what we make democratically, asking users what they want.
Though some decisions, like large code refactors, are decided by Veteran Programmers.


### Who's in Charge of the Project?  
QtPyHammer is managed democratically, kind of.  

In practice, the team functions as a sort of casual Oligarchy.  
There are many roles within the team, and each holds a certain level of power:

| Role                | Power                                     |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Veteran Programmers | Control the overall structure of the code |
| Programmers         | Make prototypes & write the code          |
| Paper protoypers    | Workshop ideas & design user interfaces   |
| Feature requesters  | Send in, workshop & refine ideas          |
| Testers             | Give feedback & help identify bugs        |
| Users               | Give feedback & request features          |

Programmers & prototypers make stuff, that means they get to decide what they make.  
Anyone is free to make what they want, but sometimes there are jobs that must be done.

While we make decisions democratically, we don't hold explicitly hold anyone to finishing what they start.
Pressure can be good, but remember that contributors are not paid.
We contribute out of our free time.

Veterans are well experienced in their skillsets and have spent a long time with the project.  
As a general rule, veterans get more of a say, since we expect they know what they're talking about.
