    (That's just a hammer bug, why would you replicate that)
Autogroup
 -- proximity
 -- built / focused on in the same session
 -- detail density
 -- trace diff to see original shape and reworks
Check if material needs a cubemap
 -- automatically make one if speed mapping?
 -- remind / warn on compile (not for fast) 
Choose material of new face made with clipping tool
    be smart
   Auto select new face if you switch from vertex/clip to texture mode
Filter out specific material folders in browser
Filter out specific model folders in browser
Faster load times on asset browsers in general
 -- single cached maps of the vpks
 -- search bins, (filter then load)
